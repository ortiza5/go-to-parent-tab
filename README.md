# Go to Parent Tab Browser Extension:
![icon](/icons/48.png)

A chromium based browser extension created for [@oskark](https://forum.vivaldi.net/user/oskark) on the Vivaldi Browser Forums.

This extension is for going back to the originator tab, or "parent tab", for the currently active tab. If the parent tab is still open and on the original url for the page that created the current tab, then the browser should switch to the parent tab. If the parent tab is closed or has navigated to a new url, then a new tab is created with the original parent tab's url.

## Features
* Context Menu option for going to a tab's parent tab
* Context Menu shortcut by hitting 'G' on the keyboard &nbsp;&nbsp; (*thanks to [@barbudo2005](https://forum.vivaldi.net/user/barbudo2005) on the Vivaldi Forums*)
* Keyboard shortcut option &nbsp;&nbsp;(*if using with Vivaldi, you might need to set the shortcut to **Global***)
